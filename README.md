# Transfer your files over TCP fastest as possible!

You ever wanted to rapidly transfer your files without uploading and doing all that s### required to download and doing bla bla?

So here's the project you needed, i was so f##### with file transfer services serving at like 1 kb/s, why not only transfer files directly over PCs?

And that's the reason why i created this, direct file transfer without any limitations, only set by your internet speed and your ISP

## How to use

It's simple, you can compile all the source with cmake and a C++ compiler like MSVC or clang/g++

### Tutorial for i##### like me, that i needed a tutorial to do this

This is an example, i hope you're not so f###### i#### to put "YourBeatifulPC" as a real path

```
cd YourBeautifulPC/MyMFFileTransfer
mkdir sheetIbuild
cd sheetIbuild
cmake ../Source
```

Also you can set the generator and thingies like that but who cares in that, just compile and have fun transfering all s### you want

## Dependencies

NO OTHER DEPENDENCIES TO EMBED/COMPILE/DOWNLOAD/LINK OMG

This uses only a [super tiny arg parser](https://github.com/adishavit/argh) bc i'm too lazy to do a complete arg parser with exceptions and thingies that don't need the full of my attention

### Credits

ONLY ME HAHAHA! ofc not, i give thanks to all the documentation n##### and other big f###### genius devs that made me as the s##### dev i'm now and even if they aren't here developing with me they're the base of what i'm, so thanks for everyone who supported me in this travel to be a dev

And obviously to [Adi Shavit](https://github.com/adishavit) for his arg parser
